Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))

#### Prediction Task
The Census Income dataset contains 13 independant variables for use in predicting whether final income is above or below $50,000 USD

Factors of the following options, “Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.”

##### 3) Fnlwgt-
